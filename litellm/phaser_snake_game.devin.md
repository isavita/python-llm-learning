Playbook: Snake Game Development with Phaser and TDD

## Procedure
1. Set up the project structure
- Create an `index.html` file and include Phaser library from the CDN: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/phaser/3.80.1/phaser.min.js`
- Create a `game.js` file for the game configuration and initialization
- Create a `SnakeEngine.js` file for the game engine logic
- Create a `SnakeEngineTest.js` file for testing the game engine
- Create a `GameScene.js` file for the main game scene

2. Implement the game engine using TDD
- Write unit tests for the snake movement, collision detection, and food generation in `SnakeEngineTest.js`
- Implement the corresponding functionality in `SnakeEngine.js` to make the tests pass
- Repeat the process until the game engine is complete and well-tested

3. Set up the game configuration in `game.js`
- Define the game width, height, and other configuration options
- Create a Phaser game instance with the configuration

4. Implement the `GameScene` in `GameScene.js`
- Preload assets (images, sounds) in the `preload` method
- Create game objects (snake, food, score, etc.) in the `create` method
- Update game state and handle input in the `update` method
- Integrate the `SnakeEngine` with the game scene

5. Implement game over functionality
- Detect when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself
- Display a game over message and restart option

6. Test the game thoroughly
- Play the game on different devices and browsers
- Fix any bugs or performance issues

7. Deploy the game
- Host the game files on a web server or platform (e.g., GitHub Pages)
- Share the game link with others to play

## Advice
- Keep the game engine separate from the game scene for better organization and testability
- Provide clear instructions and controls for the player

## Tips
- Use the Phaser documentation and examples as a reference
- Break down the game development into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one
- Regularly test the game on different devices to ensure compatibility
